# Experiment: teacher-B corpus review (blind, independent second opinion)

Started: 2026-08-17
Lane: teacher-B
Reviewer model: claude-opus-5 (provider: copilot), pinned explicitly so this lane
is NOT the same model that produced teacher-A (gpt-5.6-luna-current).

## Purpose

Produce a second, INDEPENDENT provisional calibration of the same 6000 corpus
records that teacher-A calibrated, so that inter-teacher agreement can be measured
afterwards. This is a review lane, not gold labels, and not evidence of model
domain capability.

## Mode: BLIND

For each record the reviewer sees ONLY:
  - source_user   (from research/ai-infra-expert/corpus/*.jsonl)
  - source_assistant (from the same raw corpus)

The reviewer MUST NOT read, open, or consult any file under
experiments/2026-08-14-teacher-a-corpus-calibration/ while producing a batch.
teacher-A's corrected_answer is deliberately withheld to avoid anchoring.
Agreement against teacher-A is computed only in a separate later analysis step.

## Isolation guarantees

- Outputs live ONLY under this directory's results/.
- teacher-A results are read-only for this lane and are never modified.
- Raw corpus (research/ai-infra-expert/corpus/) is never modified.
- Benchmark raw generations are never modified.
- teacher_lane is always "teacher-B"; teacher-A files are never overwritten.

## Scope

- train: 5399 records, in corpus order (prefix-aligned)
- validation: 601 records, in corpus order (prefix-aligned)
- total: 6000

## Output schema (per JSONL record)

Same 12 required fields as teacher-A so the two lanes are directly comparable:

  source_id           str, exact id from raw corpus, corpus order preserved
  teacher_lane        "teacher-B"
  teacher_model       "claude-opus-5-current"
  calibration_status  "provisional"
  decision            one of keep | rewrite | reject
  source_user         exact copy of raw corpus user content
  source_assistant    exact copy of raw corpus assistant content
  corrected_answer    non-empty str, teacher-B's independent answer
  quality_dimensions  {technical_correctness, instruction_coverage, operational_safety} ints 1-5
  risks               list[str]
  evidence_required   list[str]
  confidence          float in [0,1]

## Status

Progress: train 30/5399; validation 0/601; total 30/6000; remaining 5970.

Runs are appended below, newest first.

  was read, opened, grepped, or listed while producing this batch.

Technical topics covered by this batch. All ten records are `Knowledge/Concept`,
difficulty medium, concept `kv_cache`, and split across three question families:
(a) measurement plans for validating whether the KV cache helps a serving workload
(variants 4-5), (b) the assumptions that must be declared before any KV-cache
performance claim (variants 1-5), and (c) how the KV cache differs between training
and inference (variants 1-3). The rewritten answers cover: the KV sizing identity
kv_bytes = 2 * layers * seq_len * kv_heads * head_dim * bytes_per_elem; paged
allocation and bounded internal fragmentation; the decode bandwidth roofline
TPOT_floor ≈ kv_bytes / achievable_HBM_bandwidth; prefix caching / RadixAttention
hit-rate mechanisms and multi-tenant reuse leakage; KV quantisation as a
throughput/accuracy trade with a greedy-token equivalence gate; tensor-parallel KV
sharding and the GQA case where kv_heads < TP forces replication; disaggregated
prefill/decode (Mooncake, NVIDIA Dynamo) with KV moved over RDMA/RoCE, GDR and
HCA-to-GPU affinity, and PFC/ECN pause-frame counters as the fault signal; and
open-loop vs closed-loop load generation as a statistical-validity assumption.
Every record carries an explicit falsifiable hypothesis, a boundary condition, an
evidence list, and a rollback gate.

Uniform assessment for this batch: every `source_assistant` is the same generic
KV-cache definition regardless of which question was asked, so
instruction_coverage is 1 across the batch while technical_correctness is 4 (the
statement itself is true, just not responsive). Decision is therefore `rewrite`,
not `reject`: the prompts are usable, the paired answers are not.

IMPORTANT: these results are PROVISIONAL teacher-B review output. They are not
expert gold labels, they have not been validated by a human domain expert, and
they say nothing about any model's domain capability. Agreement with teacher-A is
deliberately unknown at this point and is computed only in a separate later step.

  was read, opened, or grepped while producing this batch. Only source_user and
  source_assistant from the raw corpus were consulted.

Technical topics covered by this batch: still the KV cache cluster (concepts=["kv_cache"],
task_type=explanation), now spanning three prompt intents — (a) two failure modes / trade-offs
(easy variants 3-5), (b) how KV cache interacts with latency, throughput or memory (medium
variants 2-5), (c) a measurement plan validating whether KV cache helps a serving workload
(medium variants 1-3). The rewrites cover: the per-sequence size model
2 * layers * seq_len * num_kv_heads * head_dim * dtype_bytes with a worked 1.07 GB example
stated as an assumption; decode as an HBM-bandwidth-bound regime and the
max(compute, (weight_bytes + batch*kv_bytes)/BW) roofline with its throughput knee; paged
allocation, internal vs. external fragmentation and block-table indirection; prefix-cache reuse
correctness hazards under LoRA swap, KV-dtype change or position-offset change (silent wrong
logits, no crash signal); preemption thrash with swap-over-PCIe vs. evict-and-recompute and the
crossover between them; per-tenant KV quotas and p99 tail unfairness; the mitigation lever set
(GQA/MQA, fp8/int8 KV, paging, prefix caching, disaggregated prefill/decode in the
Dynamo/Mooncake style with KV transfer over RDMA/RoCE and GPUDirect RDMA); and multi-GPU
behaviour where tensor parallelism shards the cache by TP degree but adds an NCCL collective
latency floor that makes cross-node TP for decode normally the wrong choice, while pipeline
parallelism does not shard KV within a stage at all. The measurement-plan records specify
production-trace replay rather than fixed-length synthetic load, one-variable-at-a-time arms,
closed-loop load generation, three repetitions with warm-up discarded, three-layer
instrumentation (client / engine / DCGM GPU counters), cold-vs-warm prefix-cache reporting, a
two-direction capacity perturbation to separate compute-bound from bandwidth-bound from
capacity-bound behaviour, and pre-registered falsifiable thresholds with explicit rollback gates.

Why every record was marked rewrite: the raw corpus again reuses one identical single-sentence
assistant answer verbatim across all ten records and all three distinct prompt intents. The
sentence is not false about caching and the memory-scaling factors, but it answers none of the
asked questions — no enumerated failure modes, no latency/throughput/memory interaction, and
no measurement plan whatsoever. It carries no units, no boundary condition, no falsifiable
hypothesis, no required evidence and no rollback gate. instruction_coverage was scored 1/5 for
all ten; technical_correctness 3/5 (non-false but under-specified); operational_safety 2/5
(gives an operator nothing actionable and no blast-radius control).

  was read, opened, or grepped while producing this batch. Only source_user and
  source_assistant from the raw corpus were consulted.

Technical topics covered by this batch: all ten records sit in the KV cache cluster of the
Knowledge/Concept category (concepts=["kv_cache"], task_type=explanation, difficulty=easy),
split across three prompt intents — (a) define KV cache and why it matters, (b) contrast KV
cache against a naive no-cache decode path, (c) name two failure modes / trade-offs. The
rewrites cover the autoregressive caching mechanism itself, the per-sequence size model
bytes = 2 * layers * seq_len * num_kv_heads * head_dim * dtype_bytes (explicitly num_kv_heads,
so GQA/MQA reduces it), the shift of the decode bottleneck from GEMM FLOPs to HBM capacity and
bandwidth, paged/block KV allocation and fragmentation, capacity exhaustion under concurrency
with preemption / evict-and-recompute / host-memory swap over PCIe, and the mitigation
trade-space (GQA/MQA, fp8-int8 KV quantization, offload, sliding-window/eviction) with its
quality cost.

Why every record was marked rewrite: the raw corpus reuses one identical single-sentence
assistant answer across all three distinct prompt intents. That sentence is technically
non-false about caching and memory scaling factors, but it does not answer the contrast or
failure-mode variants at all, carries no units, no quantitative size model, no explicit
boundary condition tied to an HBM budget or concurrency level, no falsifiable claim, no
required evidence and no rollback gate. Instruction coverage was therefore scored 2/5 for the
definitional variants and 1/5 for the contrast and failure-mode variants.

Provisional status disclaimer: these teacher-B outputs are PROVISIONAL model-authored review
notes. They are NOT expert gold labels, have NOT been validated by a human domain expert or by
execution against real hardware, and they are NOT evidence of any model's domain capability.
Numeric examples in corrected answers are order-of-magnitude illustrations and must be
re-derived from the actual model config before use. Inter-teacher agreement against teacher-A
is deliberately NOT computed here; it is a separate, later, independent analysis step.
